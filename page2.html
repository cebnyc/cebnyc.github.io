    <p style="color:white";>Nobody wants to feel confined, a need for freedom is why people fight for their beliefs to this day. Freedom of choice is the most important thing someone can have, because that allows them to pave a path for themselves to walk on.
Freedom has a textbook definition as the power or right to act, speak, or think as one wants without hindrance or restraint. Freedom to me is allowing a person to make their own choices when they are capable to. In my life tasting freedom without restraint tended to be bitter. I felt uneasy when asking for freedom, because no matter how much my mom trusted me, she has yet to trust other people in the outside world. With all respect she is entitled to that, just as I am entitled to a childhood. My choices weren’t my own, but instead were the best options in others opinions. My character needed development, if I wanted to taste the sweet taste of freedom that I sought for.
Freedom isn’t easy to come by, for me, freedom can seem simple, like freedom of choice; what shoes you want to put on, who you trust, or even choices that may harm you. In all honesty these are the freedoms I take for granted. My room is my freedom. I wake up, smell the air wick, and turn on and off LED lights daily. Each task, although minute, still holds the freedom of choice that I seek out. My room allows me to understand my choices, be myself in a safe space, and also find myself through the changes and choices I make. The big picture is that how I look at my room is a representation of how my mother looks at me. As I am her safe space and her comfort, my room is mine. 
Comfort and solitude within my room became less of a freedom and more of a burden as time continued. As I developed mentally and physically, my room changed with me, but freedoms’ aroma still lingered behind. I wanted freedom to catch up to me, but I didn’t understand why I left it where I did. Why is it that something I have always wanted was left behind like it was nobody's business? When did I lose interest in the taste of that sweet aroma? 
I never did.
Freedom evolved just as I did. The freedom to go to school on my own was no longer, it was now the freedom of a gym membership. Choices changed as I matured. Even with my new found choices, I felt anchored down to the fact that I never had these choices before. My life felt controlled, it seemed that my decisions weren’t my own.
My mom has always taught me that anyone outside of the house can do anything to me if they choose to. She understands that the world can be scary to sheltered eyes. To be honest, I am only now grasping what she has been saying, how my age, blackness, and lack of knowledge stopped me from fully tasting freedom's palette. Long nights of conversing with my mom and trying to find common ground on how I can fully taste freedom, became more and more apparent as I matured. I understand how loving she is, after all, she made decisions with her best interest in mind; to protect me.
I’m older now and I am tasting and enjoying certain freedoms. Although my pallet isn’t quite full, it suffices my younger self because I know where I am in life now. All the freedom in the world and I will still have the one percent of my mom wondering where I am or what I am doing, but her wonders are out of love, not confinement.
